# What Is This?

This Movie App is a MERN stack project. The Movie Database given by MongoDB was used as a source of information. Node.js and Express.js were used to establish the back end and middleware of the project. React was used to establish the front-end with search, queries, filters and sorting the database information. 

# How To Use It

Simply type in your query in the top search bar. You'll search through 40,000 movies from the beginning of the cinema age through to more modern movies. When your results return, paginate through them 10 at a time.

# Limitations

Due to the databases limited entries, more modern movies aren't present. 

# Future Plans

In the future we add more features such as adjustable pagination limits, more displayed information on queries, user accounts and favorited movies. It is also possible we'll add pop-up windows to display all information about a movie.

# What Did I Learn

I learned more about establishing a full-stack application. I had previous worked on tutorial sites but this was my first attempt at a project on my own.
